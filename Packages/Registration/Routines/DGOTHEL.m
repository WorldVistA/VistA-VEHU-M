 ;This API is called by the DG LOAD EDIT SCREEN 7 Input Template after the Primary Eligibility 
 ;has been entered/changed or the Eligibility Factor has been changed to save to the 
 ;ELIGIBILITY CHANGES multiple in file #33
CRTEELCH(DGDFN,DGIEN,DGDT) ;
 ;Input parameters:
 ;  DGDFN   The IEN of the patient in file #2
 ;  DGIEN   If it contains a number, it is the IEN of the entry in file #33
 ;          Otherwise we need to check if there is an entry and use it if necessary
 ;  DGDT    Date of activity
 ;Result:
 ;  0   No entry necessary - no change in Primary Eligibility
 ;  1   An entry was made to subfile #33.02
 ;  -1^Message  The update failed
